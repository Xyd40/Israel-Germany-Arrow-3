# Israel-Germany-Arrow-3
Arrow 3 missile defense system
November 14 2023
The recent defense deal between Israel and Germany for the Arrow 3 missile defense system for $3.5B is a significant deal, not only because it is Israel's largest defense transaction to date, but also because it represents a growing partnership between Israel and Germany on security matters. 

The Arrow 3 system is one of the most advanced missile defense systems in the world, and it is designed to intercept ballistic missiles outside of the Earth's atmosphere.

This gives it a number of advantages over other missile defense systems, including the ability to intercept missiles at longer ranges and reduce the risk of collateral damage.

The development of the Arrow 4 missile defense system is already underway, and it is expected to be even more advanced than the Arrow 3 system. 

The Arrow 4 system is expected to be able to intercept a wider range of threats, including hypersonic missiles

The collaborative efforts of Israel and the US on missile defense are essential to protecting both countries from the growing threat of ballistic missiles. 

I am excited to see how the Arrow 4 missile defense system develops.

The 'Arrow 3' system was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries
